# route-finding
This is an implementation of route finding in prolog. Use a prolog compiler such as GNUProlog or SWI-Prolog. (Personally I use SWI-prolog)

- in your chosen compiler, compile the program by entering:  ['Route-Finding.pl']. 

- use any of the predefined predicate in the source code - an example being the predicate: route(wellington, auckland, X). 
  which should return X bound to a route between wellington to auckland.
